Nullscape keeps the End as a barren, depressing, and bleak place: as it should be, and always will be.

## Notes
- Nullscape is **not** compatible with the majority of end worldgen projects; except Better Nether
- Do not add this to an existing end - reset yours first, or use a new world
- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)

## Description
Nullscape will make you feel tiny and alone in the vast expanse of the End. You against the void - nothing more than that.
Nullscape boosts the End's height to 384 blocks, and makes full use of 1.18's modern features to generate incredibly varied terrain. You'll find everything from shattered islands, to floating valleys, to crystallized peaks! Different regions of the End - on very large scales - have different properties and feelings to allow for almost infinite variation in terrain shapes. From sponge-like porous terrain, to stretched alien landscapes, to stacked rounded islands; you'll find new and interesting terrain no matter how far you go.
